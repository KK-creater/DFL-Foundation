# DFL Foundations — Professional NGO Website (Static)
Design: Bright NGO Theme (Blue + White + Yellow) — Layout: Slideshow Banner + Quick Donate Button

## What you received
- Static HTML/CSS/JS scaffold with pages: index, about, projects, donate, volunteer, gallery, events, csr, blog, contact
- `assets/` contains logo and SVG placeholders
- `posts/` contains sample blog post
- `styles.css` and `script.js` for styling and demo interactions

## Notes
- Donation/Volunteer/Contact forms are frontend-only demo forms. To accept real donations, integrate a payment gateway (Razorpay/Stripe) and server-side processing.
- To deploy: host on any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
- Replace placeholder SVG images in `assets/images` with your real photos for production.
